# Envelope Ordering Site

Site which was previously used for ordering at a printing company. I made this in the summer of 2018, when I just turned 17. The site had over 170 orders before the company went bankrupt. And was used for multiple orders every week. The password can be found in plaintext: `Gebruiker127`. In hindsight, I would have done a lot of things differently, but whatever. It worked very well for what it was worth.

## Installation

Import `export.sql` and change `getDB()` in `functions.php` accordingly. Run the site in PHP 7.3.17, no custom config if I remember correctly.
